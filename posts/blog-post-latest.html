                    <p>I am super excited to embark on this front end journey, leveraging the Bertelsmann's Next Gen Tech Booster Scholarship on <a href="https://udacity.com">Udacity</a>'s <em>Front End Developer</em> program.</p>
                    <p>This is my third nano degree program on Udacity, and second Bertelsmann scholarship.
                        I have completed the nano degrees <em>Intro to Machine Learning using PyTorch</em> and <em>Azure Architect using Microsoft Azure</em> in previous years.
                    </p>
                    <p>As with all the scholarship programs, this one too started with a challenge course carved out from the nano degree program.
                        Having used javascript frameworks at work, it was interesting to understand how the core underlying tools - HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (more of this coming in the days ahead) - dance together to help the frameworks render the magic on browser UIs.
                        I could not help but allow Daniel's (HTML, CSS content instructor) super-contagious enthusiasm rub off on me.
                        Thank you, Daniel &#128591;.</p>
                    <p>I went through all the class videos once again to refresh on HTML and CSS.
                        I tried to experiment with most of the learnings from the first module.
                        While I was at it, I also learned about many more flexbox features from css-tricks.com and tried flex-flow in this project.
                        With this I'm submitting the project for review and keeping &#129310;.</p>
                    <p>Wish me luck!</p>
